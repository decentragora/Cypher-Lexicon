# Solidity

Solidity is a coding language used to program "smart contracts." Smart contracts are like digital agreements that are executed and enforced automatically by code. Solidity is used on the Ethereum blockchain which is the most popular blockchain for smart contracts. Solidity is similar to other coding languages, but it is unique in its syntax and specifically designed for smart contract development.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
It's important to use the latest released version of Solidity when deploying contracts because new features and security fixes are introduced regularly.

While most programming languages are "dynamically typed", Solidity is "statically typed." This means that every variable in a Solidity program must have a specific type (such as "int," "string," or "bool"), which must be declared when the variable is created. Solidity also supports inheritance (meaning that one contract can be based on another contract), libraries, and complex user-defined types.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;You can use Solidity to create contracts for a variety of purposes, such as voting, crowdfunding, and multi-signature wallets.
