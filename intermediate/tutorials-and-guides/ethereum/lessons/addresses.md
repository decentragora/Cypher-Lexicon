# Addresses

Externally Owned addresses (EOA) are the most common type of Ethereum address. They are made up of public and private key pairs, which you need in order to access your funds. The public key is your Ethereum address, which is a 42-character hexadecimal address derived from the last 20 bytes of the public key controlling the account. The private key is what allows you to access your funds.&#x20;

It is important to keep your private key safe, as it can be used to access all the funds in your address. To view your Ethereum address, you can use a wallet. A wallet is an interface that allows you to manage your account, as well as your public and private key pair.
