# ðŸ›¡ Protecting

Web3 being the next phase of the internet means that along with that comes a number of new dangers and precautions that users must take if they are wanting to keep themselves and their assets safe from attackers. Web3 is attempting to get rid of these big tech giants and create a decentralized web. Almost like what cryptocurrencies are attempting to do with the large financial companies and the government.&#x20;

The end goal here is to make it so web3 can provide a consistent, singular platform-agnostic approach to the management of data across systems without the need of a centralized authority that has it's own goals. The overall ecosystem will be managed by a decentralized autonomous organization(DAO).&#x20;

### Intro to web3 security

However, this is where the security questions start need to start being answered, security in web3 is so important because the data exists outside of a centralized and secure entity where there is only one entry point. There are a number of factors that users should consider when they are make their way through the web3 world. Here are a few pointers to try and remember that will leave you feeling more confident in your abilities and knowledge.&#x20;

When we talk about web3 systems, traditional security design systems are just as important as any other part. The builders must remember it is very important to incorporate security minded criteria in their infrastructure, designs and products themselves.&#x20;

**Technologies must come secondary to the principles that inform their design**.

&#x20;Even though security-by-design principles come first, you must then consider which type of blockchain will most benefit you.&#x20;

**Public and Private blockchains** - Public blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana, are open and will allow any user to join. They then have the ability to access to a number of different degrees of anonymity depending on the applications you will be using. But when it comes to using a private blockchain, the users are required to confirm your identity but also a membership and access privileges.&#x20;

These different blockchains have a various amount of distinct complexities, meaning that just because you understand one does not mean that you will have a strong understanding of the rest of them. It involves a wide array of hybrid infrastructures such as sidechains, cross-chains, federations, oracles and other distributed ledger components inform other criteria such as speed, efficiency and resilience and all of these interface with the security team.&#x20;

### Web3 Market and Trust

When using web3 we must remember that it is still in it's early learning stages and with that in mind there are a number of issues you will find yourself coming across. Not only on the technology side but also legal, cultural and economic factors that users must be considering. Even beyond the identity factor, different jurisdictions have different regulations when it comes to crypto technologies. Plus a good number of web3 entities are projects or decentralized autonomous organizations. Then you must also put into consideration the security implications of social engineering.&#x20;
