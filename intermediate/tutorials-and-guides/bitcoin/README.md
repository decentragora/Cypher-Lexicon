# ðŸŸ  Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that was introduced to the public in 2009 anonymously by a group or singular developer. It acts as a form of virtual money and is not controlled by a single person, group or company which is why there is not need for a third party to assist in any financial transactions. Because of it's popularity it has been the source behind many other cryptocurrencies after it.&#x20;

If we are talking about bitcoin as just a currency then it is quite simple to understand and implement what it is you are wanting to do, for example if you own a bitcoin then you would be able to take smaller portions of that bitcoin to use to buy goods and services. But to get deeper into how that all works is when it could start to get complicated.&#x20;
