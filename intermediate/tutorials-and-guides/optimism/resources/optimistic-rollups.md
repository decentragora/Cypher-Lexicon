# Optimistic Rollups

Optimism uses rollups which we talked about before, it is ideal because when so many transactions are rolled up into a single transaction, the gas fee required to pay comes down to only a single transaction that is distributed across everyone involved. The reason they are called optimism rollups is because transactions are assumed to be valid until proven false, in other words innocent until proven guilty. But there is a time where potential invalid transactions can be challenged by putting in a 'fraud proof' and running the transactions computations with reference with available state data. Optimism will reimburse the gas that is needed to run the fraud proof.&#x20;
