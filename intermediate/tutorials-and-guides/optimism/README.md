# 🔴 Optimism

Optimism has been on the come up recently and many users are finding it very functional and useful. The transactions themselves take place on Optimism but the transactions actual data are posted on the mainnet which is then verified. Optimism is governed by it's eponymous token, OP of short. A portion of the OP supply was airdropped to early Optimism users in late May of 2022, the developers say they will continue to airdrop more tokens in the future. &#x20;
