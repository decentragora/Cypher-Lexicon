# üî¥ Optimism

Optimism is one of the Layer 2 scaling solutions, and is powered by a technology called Optimistic rollups, which takes large amounts of transaction data and turns them into more manageable batches. Being on Layer 2 that means that it functions on top of the Ethereum mainnet (layer 1). Transactions take place on Optimism, but that data about the transactions get posted to the mainnet where they become validated. Optimism is becoming one of the most popular later 2's just like Arbitrum, a big reason for that is because Optimism is much cheaper than Ethereum. The transactions take place on optimism&#x20;

## How it works&#x20;

Optimism is governed by it's eponymous token, or OP for short. Is is the second largest Ethereum layer 2 with a total of $313 million locked into it's smart contracts as of 2022, Arbitrum comes in first with $1.32 billion.&#x20;

### OP token&#x20;

OP is Optimism's token that they released on May 31st 2021 with a total of 231,000 addresses were eligible to claim 214 million OP tokens for free, which is known as an airdrop. The purpose of the OP token is to give holders participation rights in the optimism collective, which is split up into a two tier governance system. The Token House and The Citizens' House, with Citizens' House releasing later in 2022. The Token House that is in charge or governing the decisions related to optimism.&#x20;

### Using Optimism&#x20;

For the users that are used to using the ethereum mainnet you should feel pretty comfortable as Optimism is quite similar. Your Optimism address will be the same as your Ethereum mainnet address. For users that are familiar with the Ethereum mainnet then you will find this pretty easy to adapt to as they are quite similar. Your Optimism address will be the same as your ethereum mainnet address that begins with 0x. It also supports many of the most popular decentralized finance wallets (DeFi) in the world including Metamask the most used.&#x20;

There are a couple of ways to connect to the optimism network, you could always manually configure your wallet for optimism, or an easier way is to go to one of the many DeFi apps available. For example Uniswap, then choose optimism as your network (usually located at the top of your screen). Then your metamask will add the new network and switch to it. But remember you will need ETH to cover the gas fees, just like the ethereum mainnet. To finally start using Optimism you will need to send yourself ETH to your metamask from another chain like ethereum mainnet.&#x20;
