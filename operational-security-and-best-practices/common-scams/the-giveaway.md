# ðŸ˜• The Giveaway

There are many giveaway scams in web 3.0, and they usually involve someone offering free gifts or prizes in exchange for liking, sharing, or commenting on a post. Sometimes, the scammer will also ask for personal information such as an email address or phone number. Giveaway scams are often used to get people to like or follow a page, or to get them to click on a link that leads to a malicious website.

If you see a giveaway that looks too good to be true, it probably is. Don't engage with it, and don't give away any personal information. If you're unsure whether a giveaway is legitimate, you can do a quick online search to see if others have reported it as a scam.&#x20;
