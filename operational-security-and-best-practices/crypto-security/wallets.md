# ðŸ’¼ Wallets

Wallets are programs used to interact with various Block-Chains. Technically, coins/tokens themselvesâ€“ Bitcoin/Ethereum is not stored in the wallet. Instead, wallets can interact with stored data on the Block-Chain, Using a Public key to find data including balance, and transaction history. A private key is used to access the wallet and transact the tokens allocated to that public key.

Keys are a string of numbers that point to a wallet/address, identifying the owner. Block-Chain technology is secured with cryptography. Which means encoding and decoding data. This feature removes the need for a 3rd party/intermediary such as a bank. Wallets use two key's [Public](public-and-private-keys.md#public-key) and [private](public-and-private-keys.md#private-key) keys.

## Hot Wallet

Hot wallets are normally always connected to the internet, these come in many forms Web-based wallets, mobile wallets, & desktop wallets. Hot wallets on average are more susceptible to attack, with web wallets being the most vulnerable.  The most popular web wallet currently in use is [Meatmask](https://metamask.io/download/) by [ConsenSys](https://consensys.net), with roughly 30million monthly users, although it does have a mobile version. Metamask is installable on these browsers as an extension (ie; Firefox, Google Chrome, Brave Browser, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Android, and IOS.). By connecting to the Ethereum network using Web3, users can access a whole array of decentralized financing tools, such as [Decentralized exchanges](../../understanding-ethereum/defi/dexs.md), [Yield Farming](../../understanding-ethereum/defi/yield-farming.md), and the ever-expanding [Defi (Decentralized Finance).](../../understanding-ethereum/defi/)
