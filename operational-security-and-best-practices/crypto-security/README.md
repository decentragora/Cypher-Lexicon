# Crypto Security

In the wake of major hacks and heists that have taken place within the cryptocurrency industry, it’s become more important than ever to take steps to ensure the security of your digital assets. Here is a guide to some of the most important things to keep in mind when it comes to crypto security.

### Keep your private keys private

This may seem like an obvious one, but it’s worth repeating: never share your private keys with anyone. Your private keys are what give you access to your cryptocurrency, and if someone else gets ahold of them, they could easily steal your funds.

* Store your private keys offline

If you want to be extra-safe, you can store your private keys offline, in a “cold wallet.” That way, even if your computer is hacked, your keys will be safe.

* Use a strong password

When you create an account on a cryptocurrency exchange or wallet, make sure to use a strong password that’s difficult to guess. And don’t use the same password for multiple accounts!

* Enable two-factor authentication

Most exchanges and wallets offer the option to enable two-factor authentication, which adds an extra layer of security to your account. With two-factor authentication, you’ll need to enter a code that’s sent to your phone in addition to your password in order to log in.

* Keep your software up to date

Make sure you’re using the latest version of your wallet or exchange’s software, and that you have all the latest security updates installed on your computer. Hackers are always finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities, so it’s important to stay up to date.

* Be careful what you click on

Be careful what emails and links you click on, as hackers can use phishing scams to try to steal your information. If you’re ever unsure about an email or link, it’s best to lean on the side of caution and not click on it.

* Use a reputable exchange

When you’re ready to buy or sell cryptocurrency, make sure you’re using a reputable exchange. There have been a number of hacks on exchanges in the past, so it’s important to do your research to make sure you’re using a safe and reliable platform.

* diversify your holdings

One way to reduce your risk is to diversify your holdings across multiple exchanges and wallets. That way, if one exchange is hacked, your funds won’t all be in one place.

* Monitor your accounts

Be sure to keep an eye on your accounts and transactions to look for any suspicious activity. If you see anything that doesn’t look right, be sure to report it to the exchange or wallet immediately.

* Have a backup plan

Last but not least, it’s important to have a backup plan in case your primary method of storing your cryptocurrency is compromised. This could include storing your funds in a cold wallet, as well as having a backup of your private keys in a safe place.
