In markets, aggregators fetch the best price available in a market from a variety of sources. Providing an 'aggregated quote.' \[Refer to 1inch Exchange or Paraswap]

A distributed, digital, hyper-ledger. (DLT)

**Cryptocurrency**

A digital currency in which transactions are verified and records maintained by a decentralized system using cryptography, rather than by a centralized authority.

**Multi-Signature Smart Contracts (Multi Sigs)**

Are cryptocurrency wallets that require two or more private keys to sign and send a transaction.&#x20;

The storage method requires multiple cryptographic signatures (a private key‚Äôs unique digital fingerprint) to access the wallet. (Refer to [**Gnosis Safe**](https://gnosis-safe.io/))
