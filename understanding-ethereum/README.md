# ðŸ§™ Understanding Ethereum

## Ethereum's Goal

Ethereum's goal is to give everyone access to digital money and financial services, banking for everyone. Utilizing a peer-to-peer blockchain network to skip the need for intermediaries, allows Ethereum to be censorship-resistant. Meaning it's near impossible for an entity to stop you from using the service. Creating a level playing field for everyone involved. Ethereum is constantly being upgraded to suit user's needs if you wish to learn more follow the [Ethereum road map](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/).

## How Ethereum Works

Ethereum works on a blockchain consensus that provides security and transparency, currently using the PoW chain to validate transactions. Shortly Ethereum will hard fork into a PoS chain to validate transactions. Think of the Ethereum blockchain as a highway and the Ether transactions as vehicles driving on the highway. To transact on the Ethereum blockchain you will need to pay a small fee to the validators of the network, known as Gas Fees. Gas fees are measured in a smaller unit of Ether; Gwei. Ether would be the base which can be broken down into 18 decimal places, see the table below.

A decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of fraud or third-party interference. The blockchain platform establishes a peer-to-peer network that securely executes and verifies application code, called smart contracts. Smart contracts allow participants to transact with each other without a trusted central authority. Ethereum is an open-source, programmable, decentralized platform built on blockchain technology. Compared to Bitcoin, Ethereum allows for scripting languages that have allowed for application development.
