# ðŸ’± DEX's

Decentralized exchanges let users trade/swap cryptocurrencies on a peer-2-peer network allowing for transactions to take place securely with no need for an intermediary. They aim to try and solve problems that inherit from centralized exchanges. With no central authority, these exchanges normally do not require KYC (know your customer).

### Defis & DEXs

The massive boom for defi in 2020 led to the community making more products including DEXs. Uniswap was of the first big exchanges that were built on top of Ethereum. Today there are more options for users including layer 2 protocols.\`

### Advantages of DEXs

#### Custody:

* DEXs are non-consortial, meaning users don't have to give the security of owning their own seeds/keys, to transact with the exchange. They offer users the ability to trade without having to entrust their funds to a central authority. This means that users can keep their funds safe and secure without having to worry about the security of the exchange.

#### Diversity:&#x20;

* DEXs can give a user more access to an increased number of cryptocurrencies. These exchanges offer users the ability to trade a variety of different cryptocurrencies, giving users more choice and flexibility when it comes to trading

#### Trustless Transactions:&#x20;

* DEXs use smart contracts to process trades, which means that there is no central authority controlling the funds. This offers users the ability to trade without having to trust a central authority with their funds.

#### Liquidity benefits:

* DEXs don't have to worry about the same level of liquidity as a traditional exchange as the order book is on-chain. This allows for a more streamlined trading experience as there is no need to worry about the order book being drained.

#### Fees:&#x20;

* DEXs often have lower fees than their centralized counterparts as there are no middlemen to take a cut of the profits.

#### Security:

* DEXs are often seen as more secure than centralized exchanges, as there is no central point of attack. Hackers would need to attack each individual user in order to steal their funds, as opposed to a single exchange. This means that users can trade on a DEX without having to worry as much about their funds being hacked.



### Disadvantages of DEXs

#### Liquidity: [yield-farming.md](yield-farming.md "mention")

* DEXs are relatively new and don't have the same volume as bigger exchanges, leading to slippage.

#### Scalability:

* Due to DEXs having to run on a BlockChain they a limited to how many transactions per second there can be.

#### Complicated User Interfaces:

* The average person might be turned off by the complicated interfaces.
