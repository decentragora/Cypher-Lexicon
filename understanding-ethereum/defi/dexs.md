# ðŸ’± DEX's

Decentralized exchanges let users trade/swap cryptocurrencies on a peer-2-peer network allowing for transactions to take place securely with no need for an intermediary. They aim to try and solve problems that inherit from centralized exchanges. With no central authority, these exchanges normally do not require KYC (know your customer).

### Defis & DEXs

The massive boom for defi in 2020 led to the community making more products including DEXs. Uniswap was of the first big exchanges that were built on top of Ethereum. Today there are more options for users including layer 2 protocols.
