# 🤌 Defi

DEFİ is an acronym that stands for Decentralized Finance. It is a movement that is built on the belief that financial systems should be open, transparent, and accessible to everyone. The goal of decentralized finance is to create a more inclusive financial system that is not controlled by central authorities. A DEFI ecosystem allows for the utilization of financial services such as [borrowing, lending](lending-and-borrowing.md), [trading](dexs.md), getting access to insurance, and more without the need to rely on a centralized entity.
