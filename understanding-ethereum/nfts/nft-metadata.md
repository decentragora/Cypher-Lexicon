# NFT metadata

NFT metadata is data that is stored with an NFT that describes the NFT or provides additional information about it. This metadata can include things such as the NFT's title, description, and images. It can also include more technical data like the NFT's blockchain address, transaction history, smart contract information, and trait raritie to help determine rarity scores within NFT collections.

NFT metadata is useful for both NFT owners and buyers; For owners, it can help them keep track of their NFTs and their value. For buyers, it can provide valuable information about an NFT before they purchase it. This is generally done for both owners and buyers through rarity scores on services such as Rarity.Tools, Icy.Tools, and Rarity Sniper.

Metadata can also be used to provide information to NFT marketplaces and exchanges. By tracking an NFT's metadata, these platforms can provide up-to-date information on an NFT's price, supply, and demand.

In the future, NFT metadata could also be used to create NFT portfolios and index funds. By tracking the performance of different NFTs, these products could offer investors a way to diversify their holdings and reduce risk.

Ultimately, NFT metadata has the potential to revolutionize the way we trade and invest in digital assets. By providing more information about an NFT and collection it's from, it can make the market more transparent and efficient.
