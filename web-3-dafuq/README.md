# ðŸ˜• What is Web3?

Web3 is a possible future version of the internet based on public blockchains. The appeal of Web3 is that it is decentralized, meaning that rather than accessing the internet/social media through web2 companies like Google, Apple, or Facebook. Individuals themselves, own and govern sections of the internet allowing them to have more control over their data.
