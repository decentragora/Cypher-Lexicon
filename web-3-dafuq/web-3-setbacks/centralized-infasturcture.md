  the internet.

# Centralized Infasturcture

Currently, a small number of companies control much of the internet, which gives them a great deal of power. This power can be abused, as we have seen with data breaches and censorship. A centralized infrastructure also limits the creativity and innovation that can take place on the internet, as those in control can decide what is and is not allowed.&#x20;

A decentralized infrastructure would allow for a more open and democratic internet, where anyone can contribute and there is no one central authority. By decentralizing the internet, Web3 hopes to give power back to the people and make the internet a fairer, more secure place.
