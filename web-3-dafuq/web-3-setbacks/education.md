# Education

Many people are still unaware of the potential of web3 and the implications it could have on their lives. Even those who are aware of web3 often don't fully understand how it works or what it could mean for the future. This lack of understanding could lead to problems down the line if web3 becomes more widely used.

For example, people may not know how to protect their data or may not be aware of the potential security risks. Additionally, as web3 is still in development, there is a lack of resources and educational materials available to help people understand it. (That is where [we ](../../common-cons-and-scams/decentragora.md)come in)
