description: There are a few problems with web3 accessibility that need to be considered.
---

# Accessibility

First, web3 is still in development and is not yet widely available.&#x20;

Second, even when web3 is widely available, it may not be accessible to everyone. This is because web3 is based on public blockchains, which require users to have a certain level of technical knowledge in order to interact with them.&#x20;

Finally, web3 is still a very new technology, and as such, there are not yet many applications or services that are built on top of it. This lack of applications could make it difficult for users to find ways to use web3 in their everyday lives.
