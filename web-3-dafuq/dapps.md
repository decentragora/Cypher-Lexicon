## What are Dapps

A Dapp is a decentralized application that runs on a distributed ledger, such as a blockchain. Dapps are open-source, autonomous, and anyone can technically contribute to the code. All data is stored on the blockchain, so there is no central point of failure. Holders can vote on decisions that affect the protocol of the application in response to proposed improvements and market feedback. They use a cryptographic token to access the app, and miners or farmers are rewarded in tokens for contributing value to the app. The application generates tokens according to a standard cryptographic algorithm, which serves as proof of the value that nodes are contributing to the app (Bitcoinâ€™s Proof of Work Algorithm).

* The application must be completely open-source, it must operate autonomously, and with no entity controlling the majority of its tokens. The application may adapt its protocol in response to proposed improvements and market feedback but all changes must be decided by the consensus of its users.
* The application's data and records of operation must be cryptographically stored in a public, decentralized blockchain in order to avoid any central points of failure.
* The application must use a cryptographic token (bitcoin or a token native to its system) which is necessary for access to the application and any contribution of value from (miners/farmers) should be rewarded in the applicationâ€™s tokens.
* The application must generate tokens according to a standard cryptographic algorithm acting as a proof of the value nodes are contributing to the application (Bitcoin uses the Proof of Work Algorithm).
* Turning complete meaning dapps are able to complete any task as long the resources can be loaded
* Deterministic dapps are able to perform the same functions regardless of the environment they are executed in
* Isolated dapps are executed in a virtual environment known as Ethereum Virtual Machine so that if the smart contract has a bug, it wonâ€™t hamper the normal functioning of the blockchain network





## Strengths of Dapps

### [Censorship-resistant:](dapps.md#censorship-resistant)

With Dapp's being created on the Ethereum network it becomes very difficult for governments or powerful individuals/groups to control the outcome.

### little to no downtime:

Because of its Peer-2-Peer networks, Dapps have very little downtime as other computers on the network can pick up the slack of any down computers on the network.

### blockchain-based:

Being built on the blockchain means we can with relative ease integrate cryptocurrencies such as ETH into our dapp.

### open source:

This encourages the widespread development of the dapp ecosystem enabling developers to build better Dapps accelerating the space.

## Weakness's of Dapps:

### [Hacks:](../operational-security-and-best-practices/)

Hacks are a fairly big problem due to smart contracts being open source it gives the attacks the freedom to probe for vulnerabilities. It is always recommended to use contracts that are audited although that is not a foolproof plan.

### [Ui Usability:](web-3-setbacks/user-experience.md)

Most Dapps have poor User interfaces, which can drive off a lot of new users from the space.
