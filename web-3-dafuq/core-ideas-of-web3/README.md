# ðŸ’¡ Core ideas of Web3

## A more decentralized internet&#x20;

Giving individuals more control over their data and increasing privacy. A decentralized internet is more secure because it is not controlled by a single entity.

## Ownership and control of data&#x20;

This is important because it allows individuals to control who has access to their data and how it is used. Additionally, it gives individuals the ability to monetize their data if they choose to do so.

## Increased privacy&#x20;

This allows individuals to control who has access to their information and how it is used.  Increased privacy can help to prevent identity theft and other forms of fraud.

## Greater security&#x20;

Helps to protect individuals' data from being hacked or stolen. It also helps to protect against Denial of Service (DOS) attacks and other forms of cybercrime.
