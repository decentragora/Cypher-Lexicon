# â„¢ Censorship Resistance

Web3 is censorship resistant because it is decentralized. This means that no single entity can control or censor the internet. An example of this would be if a government or company wanted to censor a certain website. With web3, they would not be able to do this because there is no central authority that controls the internet.
