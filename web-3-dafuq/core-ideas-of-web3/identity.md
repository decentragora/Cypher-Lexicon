# ðŸ˜€ Identity

In web3, identity is decentralized and controlled by the individual. This means that individuals have more control over their data and who has access to it. Additionally, a web3 identity is more secure and private than a traditional web2 identity because it is not stored in centralized databases and instead is stored on the blockchain via cryptographic keys.
