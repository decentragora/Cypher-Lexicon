# ðŸ“¡ Distributed Ledgers

A blockchain is a distributed ledger. Distributed ledger technology is notoriously known as a blockchain. A blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the historyâ€” data is highly immutable and encrypted.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_Information on a blockchain are recorded in the form of '**inputs**' known as transactions_
{% endhint %}

### Blocks and Chains?

A blockchain is a digital ledger maintaining these transactions for perpetuityâ€” or until the blockchain ceases to exist. These inputs can range from financial transactions to content publishing. Information encrypted to a public blockchain is nearly uncensorable.

There are two types of blockchains.

1. Enterprise or Corporate/Private Chains
2. Public or Open/General Purpose Chains

{% hint style="warning" %}
_There is no physical chain and blocks are numbered entries_
{% endhint %}

Transactions on a blockchain are distributed and broadcasted to the entire network. The network is a system of interconnected computers similar to the internet. A key difference being the operational layer where data is encrypted by employing sturdy cryptographic principles.&#x20;

A cluster of computers known as miners maintain the network by processing the transactions and gathering them together in '**blocks**' which are then propagated throughout the network and '**chained**' together; creating a history of inputs on a publicly available ledger.&#x20;

In order to understand how blockchain technology works in a public way, there are a few topics that need to be covered first.

* Open-source vs Proprietary software
* Economics (Covered later)
* Centralization vs Decentralization
* Governance systems
