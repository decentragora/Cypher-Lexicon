# DAO membership

Membership in a DAO is typically represented by tokens, which give holders the right to vote on proposals. In some cases, membership may be open to all token holders, while in others it may be restricted to a smaller group of people. Token holders can submit proposals to the DAO, and if the proposal is approved by a majority of members, it will be enacted. NFTs can also be used in some instances to represent membership in a DAO.
