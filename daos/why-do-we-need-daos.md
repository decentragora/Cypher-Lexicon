# Why do we need DAO's

A DAO can help to create a more decentralized organization, which can be beneficial for a number of reasons:

1\) DAOs can help to reduce the cost of running an organization by automating many of the tasks that would normally be done by employees or contractors via smart contracts.&#x20;

2\) DAOs can help to create organizations that are more resilient to external shocks, such as political instability or economic downturns.&#x20;

3\) DAOs can create organizations that are more transparent and accountable than traditional organizations since all decisions are made through a transparent process that is open to all stakeholders.
