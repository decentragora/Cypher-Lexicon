# How DAO's work

In order for a DAO to function, there must be a way for members to submit proposals and for those proposals to be voted on. There are a few different ways that this can be done. One common way is for members to submit proposals through a platform like GitHub, and for those proposals to be voted on by the members of the DAO. Another way is for members to submit proposals directly to the smart contracts that govern the DAO, and for those proposals to be automatically voted on by the members.

Once a proposal is approved by a majority of members, it is enacted. This can happen in a few different ways, depending on the type of proposal. For example, if the proposal is to change the DAO's rules, the smart contracts that govern the DAO will be updated to reflect the new rules. If the proposal is to make a decision about something, like investing in a project, the smart contracts will automatically execute the decision.
