# ðŸ§™â™‚ ðŸ§™â™‚ DAO's

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an organization that is run through a set of rules encoded as computer programs called smart contracts. DAOs are decentralized because they are not subject to the control of any single entity, and autonomous because they are self-governing. Tokens are used to represent ownership in a DAO, and token holders can vote on proposals to change the DAO's rules or to make other decisions.
