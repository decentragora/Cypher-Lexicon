# Decentralized Exchange

We briefly talked about Decentralized exchanges when we covered the section about [Centralized exchanges](../tradfi/centralized-exchange.md), here we will go in depth and give you much more detail about how it actually works. Decentralized exchanges are peer-to-peer marketplaces where cryptocurrency traders make transactions directly without handing over management of their funds to an intermediary. These transactions are facilitated through the use of self-executing agreements written in code called smart contracts.&#x20;

Decentralized exchanges were created to remove the requirement for any authority to oversee authorize trades performed in a specific exchange. These peer-to-peer exchanges refers to a marketplace that links buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies. These are usually non-custodial, which means that the users keep control of their wallets private key's.&#x20;

**Your private key is a type of advanced encryption that enables the users to access their cryptocurrencies.**&#x20;
