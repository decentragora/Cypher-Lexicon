# Decentralized Exchange

We briefly talked about Decentralized exchanges when we covered the section about [Centralized exchanges](../tradfi/modern-monetary-theory/centralized-exchange.md), here we will go in depth and give you much more detail about how it actually works. Decentralized exchanges are peer-to-peer marketplaces where cryptocurrency traders make transactions directly without handing over management of their funds to an intermediary. These transactions are facilitated through the use of self-executing agreements written in code called smart contracts.&#x20;

Decentralized exchanges were created to remove the requirement for any authority to oversee authorize trades performed in a specific exchange. These peer-to-peer exchanges refers to a marketplace that links buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies. These are usually non-custodial, which means that the users keep control of their wallets private key's.&#x20;

**Your private key is a type of advanced encryption that enables the users to access their cryptocurrencies.**&#x20;

Users are immediately able to access their cryptocurrencies once they log into the DEX using their private key.&#x20;

Decentralized exchanges use smart contracts to allow traders the ability to execute certain orders without the need for a intermediary. Where as centralized exchanges are actually managed by a centralized organization/company like a bank that is involved in financial services looking to make profits. Traders guard their funds and are held responsible if they make a mistake like forgetting their private keys or sending funds to the wrong address, that puts their assets or security at risk.&#x20;

The customers' deposited funds or assets are issued an "i owe you" (IOU) by decentralized exchange portals, which can be freely traded on the network. An IOU is basically a blockchain based token that has the same value as the underlying asset.&#x20;

The most popular and well know decentralized exchanges are built on top of blockchains that support smart contracts and where the users have full custody of their funds. With every trade comes a transaction fee as well as a trading fee.&#x20;

There are three man types of decentralized exchanges:&#x20;

1. **Automated Market Makers** - An (AMM) is a system that relies on smart contracts was first created in order to combat the liquidity problem. Inspiration to create these exchanges came from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin's paper on Decentralized exchanges. Which describes how to execute trades on a blockchain by using contract holding tokens. These AMM's must rely on blockchain based services to provide information from exchanges and other platforms in order to set the price of traded assets called blockchain oracles. The smart contracts of these decentralized exchanges use pre-funded pools of assets known as liquidity pools.&#x20;

&#x20;     Liquidity pools are funded by other users who then qualify for the transaction fees that the protocol charges for executing trades on that pair.&#x20;

&#x20; 2\. **Order Book DEX's** - Order books compile records of all open orders to buy and sell assets             for specific asset pairs. Buy orders means that the trader is willing to outright buy or just bid for an asset at a specific price. Where as sell orders indicates that the trader is ready and willing to sell or ask a particular price for the specific asset. The spread between the prices determines the depth of the order book and also the market price on the exchange.

&#x20;Order book DEX's have two main types which are on-chain order books and off-chain order books. DEX's that use order books will often hold open order information on-chain, while the users funds will remain in their wallets. These exchanges may allow traders to leverage their positions by using the funds that are borrowed by the lenders on their platform. Leveraged trading has it's advantages and disadvantages, while it increases the earning potential for trades on the other hand it also increases the risk of liquidation and it enhances the size of the position with borrowed funds, that must be payed back by the traders even if they lose their bet.&#x20;

&#x20;  3\. **DEX Aggregators** - These make use of another of different protocols and mechanisms to solve the problems to do with liquidity. The role of these platforms is to aggregate liquidity from various DEX's to minimize the slippage on the larger orders, optimize swap fees and token prices and offer the traders the best prices possible in the least amount of time. Protecting the users from the pricing effect and decreasing the likelihood of failed transactions&#x20;

&#x20;

&#x20;With all of these allowing users to trade directly with each other through smart contracts.&#x20;

The first decentralized exchanges used the same type of order books, similar to centralized exchanges.&#x20;
