  Cryptonomics in basic terms is the combined use of cryptography and economics
  to manage the functions of participants using the network.

# Cryptonomics

Cryptonomics comes from two words: cryptography and economics, the economics part of the equation is the part that gives the blockchain it's unique capabilities. But the blockchain was not the first time that a decentralized peer-to-peer system was used, for years torrent sites have used it in order to share files.&#x20;

The main purpose for Cryptonomics is to use it for properly managing design development, fund management and how decentralized networks function.&#x20;

## Applications for Cryptonomics&#x20;

**Creation of secure peer-to-peer Networks -** With using the features of Cryptonomics it is now possible to have secure peer-to-peer networks, that have minimal and manageable weak points and is very rare for glitches to occur.&#x20;

**Establishing reliable agreements -** Plays a very important part in creating effective agreements that can be executed without any issues happening. But in order for this to happen all parties involved must cooperate for the process to go smoothly.&#x20;

**Applying incentives in peer-to-peer networks -**  All participants can receive their incentives without having to stress. Offering these incentives gives the developers more leverage when it comes to making decisions about the trends and activities happening on the network.

**Creating more secure networks -** The combination of cryptography and incentives has fostered the development of a renewed system of decentralized networks. Which is more secure and also the new system is much more sustainable in the long run.&#x20;

### Bitcoin mining and Cryptonomics&#x20;

Since it's launch Bitcoin has supported a vastly growing network where users are able to get value for services and transactions without restrictions. And since the bitcoin transactions are transparent which is what makes it so appealing to users in turn increasing the trust that they have when using the system. Bitcoins sustainable mining process makes bitcoin able to do all these things.&#x20;

Bitcoin miners are also able to validate transactions on the network, and are paid in bitcoin for their work. In anticipation for the incentives for their work the miners are encouraged to work harder which keeps the network running smoothly and securely. In order to complete the mining process successfully a complex mathematical calculation must be done. That is related to the Cryptographic hash algorithm. This math is necessary because the hash algorithm binds the different blocks to the blockchain. That is how the system is able to produce accurate records of completed transactions along with their time stamp. This whole setup is called the blockchain.&#x20;

In conclusion, It supports a transparent system that rewards all of it's participants, even more the model can be used to achieve greater token distribution processes and a fair management plan. The Cryptonomics model has been tested in real time settings, and the outstanding results create more opportunities fro more efficient and reliable decentralized networks.&#x20;
