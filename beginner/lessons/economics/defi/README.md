# DeFi

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is the decentralized version of traditional finance. It uses blockchain technology to create a distributed ledger of all financial transactions. This allows for more transparency and security, as well as the ability to conduct transactions without the need for a central authority.

Defi was created in response to the shortcomings of the traditional financial system. The traditional system is centralized, meaning that it relies on a single authority to manage all financial transactions. This can lead to corruption and security breaches. Additionally, the traditional system can be slow and cumbersome, due to the need for intermediaries to facilitate transactions.

{% tab title="Benefits of Smart Contracts" %}
\- The code cannot be changed once it has been deployed (tamperproof)

\- All parties can see the code and the transactions that have been execute (transparent)

\- No third party is needed to oversee the execution of the contract (trustless)

\- Transactions can be executed quickly and automatically (fast)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Downsides of Smart Contracts" %}
\- They are irreversible

\- Once a transaction has been executed, it cannot be undone&#x20;

\- They are complex

\- The code can be difficult to understand and debug

\- They are not always private

\- Transactions can be publicly visible on the blockchain

Web3 aims to solve these problems by decentralizing the financial system. By using blockchain technology, Web3 creates a distributed ledger of all financial transactions. This allows for more transparency and security, as well as the ability to conduct transactions without the need for a central authority.
