description: Cryptography uses mathematical algorithms to encode and decode data.
---

# Overview

These algorithms are designed to be difficult to break, making it hard for unauthorized parties to access the information. The sender and receiver of the information must have the same cryptographic key in order to encode and decode the data. A key can be a number, a word, or a phrase.

There are two main types of cryptography:&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Symmetric key cryptography" %}
A single key system: the same key is used to encode and decode data. \
\
_This key must be kept secret, as anyone who has access to it can decode the data._&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Asymmetric key cryptography" %}
Also known as public-key cryptography, asymmetric cryptography uses two different keys: a public key and a private key. \
\
_The <mark style="color:purple;">**public key**</mark> can be shared with anyone, as it is used to encode the data._ \
\
_The <mark style="color:red;">**private key**</mark> is kept secret and is used to decode the data._&#x20;
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
