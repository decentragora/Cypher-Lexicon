# Usage

Email: Cryptography is used to secure email communications. Email messages are typically encrypted using a symmetric-key algorithm, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). This ensures that only the sender and receiver of the email can read the contents of the message.

File sharing: Cryptography is used to protect files that are shared between users. When a file is shared, it is typically encrypted using a public-key algorithm, such as the RSA algorithm. This ensures that only the intended recipient can decrypt and access the file.

Blockchain: Cryptography is used to secure transactions on a blockchain. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that is used to record transactions. Each transaction is encrypted using a public-key algorithm, such as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). This ensures that the transaction can only be decrypted and accessed by the parties involved in the transaction.

Secure communication: Cryptography is used to secure communications between two or more parties. Communications are typically encrypted using a symmetric-key algorithm, such as the AES. This ensures that only the parties involved in the communication can read the contents of the message.
