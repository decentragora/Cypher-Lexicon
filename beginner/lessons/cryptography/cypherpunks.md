# Cypherpunks

The Cypherpunks were a group of activists who were concerned about the lack of privacy in the digital world. They advocated for the use of cryptography to protect communications and data from government surveillance and corporate control. The Cypherpunks were instrumental in the development of public-key cryptography and the adoption of cryptocurrency, and they continue to be active in the fight for digital privacy.

The Cypherpunks were founded in 1992 by Eric Hughes, John Gilmore, and David Chaum. They took their name from the Cypherpunks mailing list, which was a forum for discussion of cryptography and privacy. The group was active throughout the 1990s, and they were instrumental in the development of public-key cryptography. They also published a number of articles and books on the topic of digital privacy.

In recent years, the Cypherpunks have been active in the fight for digital privacy. They have been involved in the development of privacy-focused software, such as the Tor network and the Signal messaging app. They have also been active in the fight against government surveillance, and they continue to advocate for the use of cryptography to protect communications and data.
