# ðŸ§° Technology

In the early days of Bitcoin if someone was wanted to purchase some they would first need to find a source, at the start there was only two ways to get Bitcoin. The first way was to mine it for yourself and the second way was to arrange a peer-to-peer meeting and trade for it. Which unlike the decentralized system and technology at the time, the actual activity of meeting up with a possible stranger was not as refined. Which many people soon came to realize and that is when the digital crypto exchanges started to show up. These gave the users the opportunity to buy sell and exchange crypto and tokens in a digital marketplace.&#x20;

Now looking at it in 2022, Bitcoin is still alive and many other currencies have come into the spotlight. In today's world, every single major technology company has taken a serious look at blockchain technology, and many have even began to build their own protocols built on either the exact same or similar foundations as those that were published by Satoshi Nakamoto.

The blockchain is simply just an addition of the advancements of the inter-connectivity and the sharing of information that we as a people have been cultivating over the many years. Saying this, we do not see blockchain technology becoming irreverent anytime in the near future. Instead we feel just like the other systems and protocols that offer advanced features for our digital interactions, blockchain will also be the foundation for future protocols that will define how we interact with each other. &#x20;
