# History

### 1960s

MIT researcher Leonard Kleinrock published a paper called “Information Flow in Large Communication Nets.” Kleinrock’s paper laid out many of the key ideas that would eventually make the internet possible, including packet switching (the technology that allows information to be broken down into small pieces and sent through a network) and routers (the devices that direct traffic through a network).

### 1970s

The first real-world implementation of the internet came in the 1970s, with the development of the ARPANET. The ARPANET was a project of the US military’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), and it was designed to be a “packet-switching” network that could continue to function even if parts of it were destroyed in a nuclear war.

### 1980s

In the 1980s, people used a pre-dial-up option called USENET to access the internet. USENET worked by connecting people to the internet using phone modems. This was before the internet was widely available, so it was limited to those who had access to phone modems, and the service was not mainstreamed. It was not as fast or reliable as today's internet.

### 1990s

US National Science Foundation (NSF) developed a new network called the NSFNET, which was based on the ARPANET. The NSFNET was designed to be a faster and more reliable network that would connect university research networks across the country. As more and more people and organizations began to connect to the NSFNET. This led to the development of [Web1](web1.md); World Wide Web (WWW), which is the system of interconnected documents and other resources that we still use today.&#x20;

### 2000s

Saw the development of social media and [Web2](web2.md) technologies, which allow users to interact and collaborate with each other online. The most popular social media platforms today include Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Web2 has also revolutionized the way we use the internet to conduct work and business. The rise of cloud computing and online services like Google Docs and Dropbox had made it possible for people to work together on projects from anywhere in the world.

### 2010s

Had seen the continued growth of the internet and its technologies. The proliferation of smartphones and mobile devices had made it possible for people to access the internet from anywhere at any time. The development of the “internet of things” (IoT) led to a new wave of interconnected devices, from smart home appliances to wearable technology. Interweaving technology into our daily lives and becoming the new normal.

### 2020s

Is sure to bring even more changes to the internet and its technologies. We are now on the verge of the era of [Web3](web3.md), which promises to be more user-centric and decentralized than the current web and is powered by the people who use it. This replacement of the internet is powered by blockchain technology.&#x20;

Blockchain, a decentralized system for storing and managing data, is beginning to change the way we think about the internet. This new generation of the internet is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we live, work, play, and communicate with each other.
