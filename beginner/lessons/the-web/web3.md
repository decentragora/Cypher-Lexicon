# Web3

### Modern Day-Future

Web3, the third iteration of the internet, is still in development. The aim of Web3 is to address the shortcomings of Web2 by using blockchain technology to create a decentralized internet that is not controlled by any single entity and is transparent.

This would allow for increased privacy and security, as well as give users more control over their data. Web3 will also use AI to create an internet that is more accessible and inclusive. This includes making sure that everyone has access to the same information and opportunities, regardless of their location or economic status. Web3 uses peer-to-peer networks to allow users to connect directly with each other without going through a central server. This would make the internet faster and more efficient. Also, things like 3D graphics will create a more immersive and realistic experience for users. The Enhanced connectivity will allow users to connect to the internet from anywhere in the world on a deeper level than what web2 could offer.&#x20;

If you are somewhat tech-savvy you might know that some of these things currently exist and are available, but adapted to the mass market or in the way that Web3 visionaries plan to implement them. What is holding web3 back from mass adoption is the development of the infrastructure, public awareness, and standards that will be necessary for Web3 to function properly.
