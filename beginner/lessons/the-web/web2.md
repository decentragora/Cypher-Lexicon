# Web2

### 2005-Current Day

Web2 was a term first coined in 1999 by Darcy DiNucci in her article "Fragmented Future", and it is used to describe the current state of the internet. Web2 is characterized by increased user interactivity, collaboration, and social networking.&#x20;

Web2 is also used to describe the transition from static HTML pages to dynamic and interactive web applications. Now many people have access to the internet and computers are commonplace in most homes. Web2 is now used for a variety of purposes, including communication, services, entertainment, and education.&#x20;

However, Web2 is centralized around a few major platforms and companies, which has led to some concerns about privacy and censorship. Some of these companies include but are not limited to, Google, Facebook, and Amazon.
