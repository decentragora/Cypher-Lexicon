# Overview

A majority of people believe that the web we surf and the internet in general are the same thing— but that is not the case. In actuality, the term _internet_ refers to the global network of servers that store and disperse all the information that we share. Servers allow the sharing information through web pages, files, applications and protocols. So, even though web pages makeup a large portion of the internet they are not the same as the— internet or world wide web.

Web pages are formatted hypertext documents. They are created in a language called Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and the websites that we visit are groupings of web pages under one domain name.&#x20;

HTML is the language that lets the users switch through pages on the web by using links. And the links all resolve to domains that host the web pages together in websites. The web uses HTML protocol to share information and transmit data.&#x20;

The web is just one of the many ways that people connect using the internet, others include email, instant messaging and File Tranfer Protocol (FTP).
