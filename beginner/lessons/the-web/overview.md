# Overview

A majority of people believe that the web and the internet are the same thing but that is not the case. But in actuality the term internet refers to the global network of servers that makes the information sharing that happens over the web possible. So even though the web does make a large portion of the internet they are no the same.&#x20;

These web pages are formatted in a language called Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) it is the language that lets the users switch through pages on the web by using links. The web uses HTML protocol to share information and transmit data. The web is just one of the many ways that people connect using the internet, others include email, instant messaging and File Tranfer Protocol (FTP).
