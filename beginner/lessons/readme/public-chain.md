# Public Chain

Anyone can access a public blockchain. They are open, accessible and typically general purpose. Sometimes they serve a specific purpose like Bitcoin.

* _Transactions using the Bitcoin network are highly uncensorable, immutable and can be facilitated without a third party._&#x20;
* _Transactions using the Ethereum network carry the same advantages of Bitcoin alongside another ability— the power of programability._

With public chains, anyone can audit the entries at any point in time. Meaning, all transactions recorded to a publicly available blockchain are transparent and outward facing.&#x20;

Any input can be referenced via transaction hashes— also known as identifiers_._ (Txn IDs)

Each hash represents a unique input that's broadcasted to the network and then computed by the blockchain before it's entered into the ledger.
