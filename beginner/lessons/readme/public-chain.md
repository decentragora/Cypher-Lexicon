# Public Chain

Anyone can access a public blockchain. They are open, accessible and typically general purpose. Sometimes they serve a specific purpose like Bitcoin. \


{% hint style="info" %}
Bitcoin is a prime example of a specific purpose chain; P2P electronic cash\
\
Ethereum is a prime example of a general purpose chain; Virtual machine + P2P cash
{% endhint %}

Transactions using the Bitcoin network are highly uncensorable, immutable and can be facilitated without a third party. \
\
Transactions using the Ethereum network carry the same advantages of Bitcoin alongside another abilityâ€” the power of programability.
