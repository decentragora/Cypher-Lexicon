# PoW Chains

Proof of Work (PoW) chains use a competitive validation method to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. The validation method involves difficult math problem to verify digital transactions.&#x20;

This problem is called a client puzzle. [**Hashcash**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash), first proposed in 1997 by [**Adam Back**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam\_Back). Hashcash **** paved the way for blockchains utilizing a proof-of-work function. In order to create a new hash, a miner must solve the puzzle. The first miner to hit the lowest target nonce 'solves' the problem. This miner creates the new block by hashing together the most recent block with the newest oneâ€” _the miner who solves the block receives a reward in the form of newly '**minted**' coins._
