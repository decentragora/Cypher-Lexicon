# PoS Chains

Proof of Stake (POS) uses randomly selected nodes to validate transactions.&#x20;

In order to do this, miners must put up a certain amount of money as a stake, which is used to determine how much power they have to verify transactions. The more money a miner puts up as a stake, the more likely they are to be chosen to validate a new block of transactions, and the more rewards they stand to earn.
