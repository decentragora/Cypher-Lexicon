# Private Chain

Blockchains require facilitation, either privately or publicly. Private chains subsidize the cost of a distributed network via operational practices.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example:** An internal blockchain is used to verify employee IDs— remotely —without publishing the data externally to a network
{% endhint %}

A private blockchain makes sense for an enterprise requiring heavy authentication, industries that exchange sensitive data or when data needs indiscriminate verification.

Private databases are maintained by private organizations and the value of their ledgers are speculative because they are closed and require third party audits.

* Company structures
* Revenues and margins
* Current state of stability or ability to scale with available resources

A private blockchain does not need a cryptocurrency to function. You can simply deploy employee/contractor '**credits**' that get consumed when services are used, provided or value is owed.  This won't mean your credits are not related to crypto, they will still be created using cryptographic principles and therefore can be classified as either; cryptocurrency or cryptotokens.\
\
Tokens or currencies issued via blockchains are protected by strong cryptographic principles. (Same standards used to encrypt military communications)&#x20;

A public chain is permissionless and open. No admin controls the network. There is 'no CEO' of a public blockchain.

With private chains, admins control entries, edits and can override functions and inputs as desired.
