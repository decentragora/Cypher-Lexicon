# üèõ Decentralization

&#x20;In the blockchain, decentralization refers to the transfer of control and decision-making from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group thereof) to a distributed network. The benefits of decentralization include increased security and transparency, as well as increased resiliency to attacks and corruption.

At the time of this writing, there is over $200 billion tied up in decentralized finance ([DeFi](../understanding-ethereum/defi/)) protocols, according to [Amberdata](https://blog.amberdata.io/defi-and-the-transformation-of-institutional-finance?utm\_medium=email&\_hsmi=210559080&\_hsenc=p2ANqtz--4jBnJwnHdMtyADjUnlFmz3EWc60XJyaMGdl1NYqYtV3SX4KRwULMEajGaUK9DCcdv2vEuHTmoCtizJjEAq1tmaLmMOQ\&utm\_content=210559080\&utm\_source=hs\_email).&#x20;
