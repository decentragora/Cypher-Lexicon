# üè¢ Centralization

Centralized exchanges are operated by a single company, which stores all of the user's data on its servers. By trusting centralized exchanges, you are trusting a single entity with your money. The problem with that is that if they are hacked, or the company goes bankrupt, you could lose all of your money which could lead to people losing their life savings or being unable to access their money when they need it.

## Examples of Centralized Companies

### Google/Amazon

There are a few potential problems with these conglomerates being centralized. First, it gives them a lot of power and control over the information and data that is available to users. This can be a problem if they decide to censor or prioritize certain types of information.

### Media Streaming Services&#x20;

Streaming services like Youtube, Twitch, Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Disney+, Spotify, Apple Music, and Google Play are examples of centralized streaming services. The main problem with these streaming services is that they can easily control the arts and media that users can access and absorb. These services retain the rights to set the royalties and commissions for content creators.

### Big Social Media

This can lead to a number of problems, including censorship, lack of privacy, and term of user services that take control of users' content through fine print. Social media platforms have the permititive authority through the fine print to use the content posted on their platforms.&#x20;

### Online Gaming

Microsoft Gamepass, Sony PS+, Google Arcadia, Steam, and Tencent own all the content, with zero ownership of the digital licensing for the consumer. This means that gamers have little choice in what games they can play, and the companies can charge high prices for access to their games. This can make it difficult for gamers to find affordable games, and it can also limit the amount of time they can spend playing.
