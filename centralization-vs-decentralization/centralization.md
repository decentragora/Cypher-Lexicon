# üè¢ Centralization

Centralized exchanges are operated by a single company, which stores all of the user's data on its servers. The problem with centralized exchanges is that you are trusting a single entity with your money. The problem with that is that if they are hacked, or the company goes bankrupt, you could lose all of your money. Also, if the government decides to regulate or ban cryptocurrencies, the centralized exchange could be forced to shut down.&#x20;
