# Cryptocurrency

A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized and often anonymous, and they are based on blockchain technology. The purpose of a cryptocurrency is to allow users to securely and anonymously send and receive payments.
